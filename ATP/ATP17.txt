             Reblogs from Tumblr: “A Hearth’s Warming Tale”

   This week I learned something new: tumblrs can be rebloged. I suppose
   my ignorance is a result of me having no experience with the platform
   and literally just jumping right in. That said, I don’t know if I can
   reblog two tumblrs within one post, so I’ll be quoting them as well
   as providing links as always.

   I agree fully with Captain Hotspot on his/her thoughts but my
   question is what do such songs contribute to the overall collection
   MLP songs. This last semester, I asked my lecturer for songwriting
   class what her criteria of a good song was, and she said “I like
   songs that have a reason to exist.” I really like this criterion
   because it implies that every good song fulfills a purpose. However,
   some of the songs from this week’s episode seem to lack that purpose,
   as their only task was to continue the plot. That itself may be a
   purpose, but it’s the purpose of the episode and the writing, not the
   song itself. Thus the song has no reason to exist other than to
   simply be another song. I suppose the real question is do we want
   songs in MLP for the sake of having songs (i.e. do nothing besides
   continue the plot) or do we want songs that are expressive? I
   personally don’t mind the more narrative focused songs, though I
   wonder whether creating them takes away from bettering other aspects
   of the show, in which I would certainly not want the staff to waste
   time and resources writing them.

   However, there are definitely a lot of other opinions out there.
   After every episode, I always find many people on EQD or Twitter
   sharing their love and appreciation for the latest MLP song, and this
   is true for every single song. On one hand, this shows that the
   fandom really appreciates everything that show staff does to make an
   episode good, and that is something I really like about the fandom.
   But at the same time, I wonder if people really do like such songs
   more than isolated gems we got from seasons of old.

    |  Now, see, I think you’re right that the emotions of a song have a
    |  lot to do with staying power and meaning, but I feel I have to
    |  speak up for the character-defining songs, as well.
    |
    |  The Smile Song, along with capturing Pinkie’s emotions at the
    |  time, captures something crucial to her character– her altruism.
    |  Then there’s Art of the Dress, which tells us who Rarity is and
    |  what her work means to her. Ironically Generosity, while maybe
    |  embodying the feeling of being excited to explore a new city or
    |  industry, doesn’t have the same effect because we can sort of
    |  gather why this character is generous without the song.
    |
    |  Dash’s character-defining-song came in season 5 with I’ll Fly,
    |  talking about her dedication to her friend no matter what the
    |  cost, but I don’t know, maybe it’s because it’s too flowing and
    |  Defying-Gravity-y for her character that it doesn’t work for me
    |  (despite being a Dash fan). It captures her denial at the time by
    |  making light of her actions, but does clashes to almost to
    |  comedic effect with her true character.
    |
    |  I think of, like, Bats! and I say, that song really captures the
    |  dichotomy of the argument in that episode, and even progresses
    |  the plot along with the girls joining AJ’s cause at the end. But,
    |  it doesn’t use this story to illustrate something new about
    |  either AJ or Fluttershy, really.
    |
    |  Not always, but sometimes it’s what the emotions work to do that
    |  really makes the difference for me.
    |
    |  A Hearth’s Warming Tail develops Starlight’s character bit by bit
    |  by revisiting her entire backstory from her perspective. The
    |  opening and reprise don’t do much to this effect, and are mostly
    |  there as fluffy set-up and conclusion. It feels good, so I’m not
    |  going to complain, but they aren’t tracks I’d ever seek out on
    |  their own. After Today, though, defines her devious, manipulative
    |  nature when we first met her, even better than Our Town because
    |  that works best as a propaganda piece to hide those true
    |  intentions. Then there’s AJ’s song, which wasn’t especially
    |  amazing to me until I heard the lines “and in that moment, though
    |  you didn’t know it / your defenses set up walls, you built to
    |  last / leading to the pony you’ve become today / that spell
    |  you’re about to cast, it all comes from your past.” The whole why
    |  didn’t she ever contact Sunburst thing is answered. While it
    |  might’ve been implied in The Crystalling, this really defines to
    |  me that Starlight developed a fear of rejection, and giving
    |  Sunburst the chance to reject her again just wasn’t something she
    |  could stand. Which is the missing puzzle piece in why she has
    |  these control issues to the point that she founded a town where
    |  everyone is always happy, she controls everything down to how the
    |  food is prepared, and no one would ever leave by choice once

    |  their saw things her way. It really contextualizes it in a way I
    |  haven’t felt they have before. And Pinkie’s song doesn’t do much
    |  in this line of thinking, but Luna’s song sure does! “I see a
    |  future caused by you / I see a path not meant to be.” Before,
    |  when we saw the wasteland future, Starlight was fighting with her
    |  anger and denial, trying to throw the blame back on Twilight, but
    |  this song gives us all of her dread, fear, and regret that was
    |  really underlying those feelings in full-force.
    |
    |  So effectively we get her entire arc again, but this time, we can
    |  emphasize with her– and they did it all with A Christmas Carol,
    |  perhaps the most well-known holiday story there is (besides the
    |  religious ones, I mean). All in all, I’d say emotions are
    |  probably the most important work the songs can do in a story, but
    |  it’s also important to consider what they say about the
    |  characters, and if they say anything at all.
    |

   Dreaming, Waiting (or is it Marvel and Ponder) makes some good points
   about many of the MLP characters being given characterization through
   the songs that they sing. I love this point, but I do think that it’s
   not as utilized within the show as Dreaming argues.

   The best example (as pointed out by Dreaming) of characterization
   through song has to be Pinkie Pie’s “The Smile Song.” The song is
   Pinkie expressing her most personal thoughts, ideas, and world views
   to those around her; it is the spirit of Pinkie Pie. It also helps
   that prior to “A Friend in Deed,” Pinkie Pie hasn’t had much
   characterization other than being pigeonholed as the crazy extrovert.
   The song lets the viewers know who she really is at heart, and once
   we understand her, how can we not love her? Unfortunately, I’d argue
   that there is no song like “The Smile Song” for any of the other Mane
   6. Sure, various facets of their character are expressed through
   their songs, but there is no single one that properly expresses them
   completely; this might be due to the complexity of their characters.
   However, if there were new songs that truly captured an entire
   character within a melody, I think they would easily become the new
   fan favorites. For instance, Rara’s “The Magic Inside” is probably
   the closest thing to “The Smile Song” as it too captures the essence
   of a single character. The song was wildly popular with many Bronies,
   though for myself not as much as I don’t care much for Rara’s
   character. But if Twilight had a song like that, well, let’s not get
   too attached to hypothetical songs.

   The other intriguing argument Dreaming presents is that all of the
   songs in “A Hearths Warming Tale” further develop Starlight Glimmer’s
   character. I agree that the backstories of Snowfall Frost and
   Starlight Glimmer are similar, but let’s not forget that the story
   being told here is Snowfall’s, not Starlight’s. The majority of the
   episode is a parable for Starlight herself to learn from, but let’s
   also not forget that it too was a parable for Twilight. Like all

   parables, it has a lesson: don’t be so obsessed with one’s studies to
   the point of missing out on friendship. It provides a neat way to
   freshen up the whole “Friendship is Magic” theme, with which the
   audience is very familiar with, but which Starlight Glimmer is just
   now learning.

   In some ways, it’s just like its predecessor, “Hearth’s Warming Eve.”
   Also in that episode, we have our Mane 6 taking on roles other than
   themselves, and it’s interesting to see how their personalities slip
   into the characters that they’re imitating. But it’s just that, an
   imitation, and we’d have to know a lot more about Starlight’s
   internal thoughts to gauge if the mapping is quite the same.
