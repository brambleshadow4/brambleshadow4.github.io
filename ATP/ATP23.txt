            Responses from the MLP Forums: “Flutter Brutter”

   I never really check out the MLP forums, but it’s often nice to break
   out of a routine.

    |  Pretty good, but I've never once met someone in real life whose
    |  reason for not holding up a job was fear of failure. I don't
    |  doubt it's a real issue for some people, but Zephyr wasn't
    |  holding down any job. If his issue really was fear of failure,
    |  fine, but you still have to sustain yourself.
    |
    |  I think it would've been more solid if they used sheer and simple
    |  laziness as his problem... then again, considering the last few
    |  minutes, maybe that was his issue all along and he just used
    |  "fear" as an excuse. I've seen and heard that plenty a time.

   Vertigo makes a good point about the episode trying to frame its
   moral one way when in fact it seems to point to another entirely.
   This interpretation makes sense to me, as I also interpreted the
   episode this way, yet I also don’t think that the episode is weaker
   because of it. The structure of a typical MLP episode is very akin to
   that of parables from works like the bible. Both present themselves
   as simple stories, but by story’s end they both present a specific
   message to the audience. The only difference is that MLP tries to
   summarize that message into friendship lessons, whereas the bible
   simply lets them sink in.

   This act of naming the lesson doesn’t change whatever insight was
   revealed through the story. At best it gives you a short quote to
   cherish and treasure; at worst it feels non sequitur and out of
   place. Such a summation also has the ability to provide another lens
   through which one can see the episode in a different light. In such
   instances, one might learn two different lessons from the same
   episode. However, this also opens up the possibility of
   misinterpreting the episode by looking too closely at the given
   moral. Episodes like “Feeling Pinkie Keen” (S1) and “Do Princesses
   Dream of Magic Sheep” (S5) both have morals which aren’t easily
   compressed into a single idea. Both of these episodes also have
   controversy around them due to their lessons. As every person will
   interpret them differently, it’s possible (and probable) that for
   some people, the given moral won’t make sense. With that in mind, I
   personally don’t have problem when an episode summarizes a lesson in
   a different way than I would; it’s very possible that their way will

    |  Well, here's the self-introspective side of me. To me, I really
    |  liked the episode for one reason, but also hated it for the same
    |  reason -- Zephyr is a pretty accurate representation of me. I
    |  know a lot of you who know me from here will be all "Oh no, you
    |  can't possibly be that much of a jerk, you're such a nice
    |  person!", but... honestly, I'm a REAL jerk IRL.
    |
    |  For one, I'd been freeloading on my parents from ever since I
    |  finished high school up to about a month and a half ago, when I
    |  got my job. That's about eight months. And it's not like I wanted
    |  to get a job then -- everything was fine; I had a phone, a decent
    |  computer, and friends on the internet that I could talk to if I
    |  needed someone. Curfew was out the window, I was an arrogant SOB
    |  and stubbornly lazy. And kind of a flirty douche. Only difference
    |  between me and Zephyr was the fact that I had decent survival
    |  training, so I could actually survive in the woods if I needed
    |  to.
    |
    |  That all changed when our monthly internet plan changed, and I
    |  was forced to pay $60 a month for my internet access. Honestly,
    |  the thing I was most afraid of was losing you guys, my friends on
    |  MLP Forums. I was so mad at my parents for making me pay for the
    |  internet that I simply jutted out my jaw, grabbed a pen and a
    |  bike, and headed off to find a job. Fifteen hours later, I'd
    |  secured employment at Little Caesars Pizza, and am now
    |  semi-happily employed, making about $400 a month.
    |
    |  So yeah, this episode has a lot to do with me. I'm still a jerk
    |  sometimes, and when I'm not working I like to browse the internet
    |  and drink coffee. And I'm still a flirty douche. But like Zephyr,
    |  I'm taking baby steps towards bettering myself. (I still have an
    |  inferiority complex, bipolar disorder, and a shocking inability
    |  to make friends to deal with, but hey... I'm up for it). Because
    |  the episode portrays recent events in my life so clearly, I both
    |  like it and dislike it. I like it because it's a very
    |  true-to-life lesson; if you're a lazy bum, you deserve to be
    |  mistreated. Go out and get a job, mother bucker. But I also
    |  dislike it, mainly because it shows me how much of a jerk I was
    |  beforehand, and I don't like bringing up foul memories.
    |
    |  The only real issue I have is that the "climax" of the episode is
    |  a musical number. The message "pull yourself up out of bed and
    |  get a job" is still there, but I can't stand musical numbers. It
    |  seems like the moral is "if your older sister sings at you,
    |  you'll get a job". And while that may be true for some people
    |  (honestly I can't stand a second of my older sister singing to

    |  me), it's still very... well, childish. Getting a job is easy,
    |  but remaining employed is really hard -- especially for the first
    |  month or so. You'll want to quit, but you can't let the world
    |  beat you. You really do have to pull yourself up by your own
    |  bootstraps.

   It’s really neat to read a response from a person who relates to
   Zephyr Breeze more than other characters. I’m actually a little
   surprised that Meson didn’t full out dislike the episode; rather, he
   pointed out the validity of its message despite it being more geared
   against him. That definitely takes maturity.

   Meson also points out the sensitivity of such a conflict. It’s very
   easy (and typical) to frame a disagreement as a person in the right
   standing against a person in the wrong. This works well enough if
   it’s the mane six framed against Lord Tirek, or the CMC against the
   Diamond Tiara of early seasons, but here it’s family versus family,
   and none of the characters are intentionally trying to make matters
   difficult. In “Flutter Brutter,” the writers chose to have Fluttershy
   be in the right, thus condemning Zephyr. However, I definitely saw
   the writers trying to interpret Zephyr in the most positive way;
   never in the episode did the characters attack Zephyr the pony on a
   personal basis. Rather, they criticized his behavior, and sought to
   have him improve. However, I’d be interested in hearing what Meson
   has to say about the subject, as I’m personally not at the wrong end
   of the gun. Did the writers ever go too far in their criticism of
   Zephyr?

   I also want to point out that it’s not the song which causes Zephyr
   to finally get a job; it’s the shock factor of actually being throw
   out and into the forest. Not everyone has the survival training that
   Meson has, and I know if I were faced with such a choice, I would get
   a job immediately without a thought.

    |  I'm not going to complain about the third act because that part
    |  of the episode practically writes itself. Where the success or
    |  failure of this episode was depended on what kind of
    |  characterization Zephyr was given in the first two acts.
    |  Unfortunately, it lined up as expected, and it wasn't good.
    |
    |  If Zephyr was supposed to be a sympathetic character, he surely
    |  didn't earn it by being a diva stereotype that forced the Mane 6
    |  to get ugly with him. It takes a special kind to drive the Mane 6
    |  to the edge that he did, and his snobbish, bratty attitude does
    |  nothing to separate the early part of the episode from basically
    |  being the cartoon equivalent of one of those anti-Millenial hit
    |  pieces put out by Gen X/Boomer mainstream media hacks.

    |  If the focus of this character had been on his fear of failure,
    |  this would have been more interesting. Instead, his
    |  self-centered, work-averse personality is played up for the same
    |  cheap laughs the older crowd would probably get out of reading
    |  one of those sermonizing hit pieces.
    |
    |  I wouldn't consider this one of the worst episodes, however.
    |  There was a good message to it, only the execution sucked because
    |  the character that drove it was so lazy he couldn't bother to be
    |  more original. The song felt awkwardly forced in, but wasn't too
    |  bad. And I'll admit seeing a filly being shielded from such mild
    |  language was amusing.
    |
    |  Having defended Dave Rapp despite being negative to "Newbie
    |  Dash", I now believe that he, along with the other Dave, have
    |  writing styles that are constantly at odds with the show's goals.
    |  The show is more story-driven than antics-driven, and if we see
    |  more episodes like those, it will be rough times ahead for this
    |  show.
    |
    |  I can't really tell where this episode's intentions were; if it
    |  was meant to poke fun at the stereotype (at which it didn't do a
    |  good job IMO) or if it was genuinely about the message. But there
    |  are better ways to do both, and for that, I'd like to move on
    |  from this one.

   Wind Chaser states that Zephyr’s failed characterization is what
   causes this week’s episode to suffer in quality, but I’m not quite
   sure where Wind’s drawing these conclusions. Wind’s definitely right
   that Zephyr Breeze appears to be characterized as a millennial, but
   we mustn’t forget that this characterization is indirect. He earns
   the label, not by being in a different generation than Fluttershy,
   but by being lazy and arrogant throughout the episode. His actions
   make it very difficult for anypony or the audience to sympathize with
   him, so I’m not quite sure where the term “sympathetic character” is
   coming from. If anything, he’s a “love to hate” type of character.

   Because of this, there definitely isn’t anything funny or humorous
   about Zephyr’s character. Rather, the joy of this week’s episode
   comes from watching how Fluttershy and Rainbow react to him. It’s a
   typical situational-comedy set up, familiar territory for FiM, but as
   various people find various situations funnier than others, I can
   understand if it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. However, calling it
   “cheap” seems unfair as the jokes are well crafted; many of them are
   built from personality traits, like Spike’s dutifulness, Pinkie Pie’s
   extraversion, Flutterhy’s serenity, and Rainbow Dash’s intolerance to
   fawning.

   I’m also not quite sure how the episode’s intention isn’t clear. With
   the song at the end emphasizing the importance of dedication and hard
   work, it seems quite clear that the episode is message driven, and
   Zephyr’s journey from being kicked out of his parent’s house to
   Flutterhy’s later on follows the usual pattern of making a mistake
   multiple times before it finally is learned.

   If Wind Chaser’s up for elaborating any more on his/her ideas, I’d be
   glad to listen.
