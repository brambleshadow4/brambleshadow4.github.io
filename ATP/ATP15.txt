                Responses from the fandom: “Newbie Dash”

   There was quite a lot of talk about the episode, and in true Polsky
   fashion, his episode appears to be quite controversial! I made the
   mistake of reading the comments before writing down my own thoughts
   (consequentially making that last post more difficult to write), but
   now we get to talk about what makes this episode controversial (but
   is it really?)!

    |  … 5. Jesus Christ, the moral. What the hell?!
    |
    |  First off, let's talk about hazing, specifically rookie hazing.
    |  It's a very common tradition in many fields to "haze" newcomers.
    |  Hazing, for that matter, has had so many controversies. Some
    |  teams will haze rookies because to them, it's good ol' fun. But
    |  not everyone receives hazing very well because what comes across
    |  as good ribbing to the veterans can come off as bullying to the
    |  rookies. And when you look at the news articles of investigations
    |  related to hazing, the resentment is very valid. For several
    |  years, hazing has been on the news for really, REALLY bad
    |  reasons. People have been bullied, hurt, and killed by people who
    |  use these hazing rituals. A lot of the time, hazing deals with
    |  abusing someone under the context of "good fun" or "tradition."
    |  The abuse ranges from being taped up to a wall or pole to
    |  paddling to being raped. There's a movement to ban school hazing
    |  and some governments criminalizing hazing. Why? Because to haze
    |  is to bully, and it's not okay.
    |
    |  What made this moral reprehensible is how Newbie Dash tolerates
    |  and embraces hazing. Why? "Because it's good fun." BULLSHIT!
    |  Rainbow Dash has every right to feel insulted and not take
    |  "Rainbow Crash" lightly. It doesn't matter if Spitfire or anyone
    |  else took their insult in stride. Not everyone does, and they
    |  have every right to say no. By being complacent, the episode
    |  tells the viewer their feelings towards insults don't matter.
    |  Words can hurt, and words can kill. Rather than ignoring it, be
    |  aware of it. Just because it's a common thing in the
    |  Wonderbolts's culture doesn't mean it's okay. Despicable moral!
    |  In short, this episode is garbage!
    |

   I remember reading this comment immediately after watching the
   episode, and I must say it did give me some doubt about whether or
   not the episode was pro-hazing. But first, we have to agree upon what
   hazing is.

   According to Google, hazing is defined as “the practice of rituals
   and other activities involving harassment, abuse, or humiliation used
   as a way of initiating a person into a group.” So at first glance,
   Rainbow Dash might indeed look like she’s a victim of hazing, as she
   is the new pony being initiated into the Wonderbolts, and she’s also
   experiencing the traditions that they have. However, I’d say the most
   important part of the definition is the “harassment,” “abuse,” and
   “humiliation.” What all three of these things have in common is that
   they are with intent to inflict pain of some kind. So if the
   Wonderbolts really are hazing Rainbow Dash, they’re calling her Crash
   with the specific intent to hurt her. At the episode’s end however,
   it is revealed that they never had such an intent.

   I don’t think that alone is enough to argue that what the Wonderbolts
   did wasn’t hazing, so the next question to ask is whether any of
   their actions appear to be with mal-intent. I specifically say
   appear, because apparent intent and actual intent are two different
   things; it’s definitely possible that the Wonderbolts mean well
   without appearing so. However, if we look at every action of the
   Wonderbolts, there aren’t any places where it doesn’t look like they
   mean well. Spitfire readily welcomes Rainbow Dash to the Wonderbolts
   and constantly checks back with her; Soarin does like wise. There are
   times where Spitfire has to yell at Rainbow Dash when she steps out
   of line, but that’s because she steps out of line; it’s nothing more
   than discipline. Even when the others call her Crash with a more
   negative tone it’s because Rainbow literally just crashed into them
   (which definitely can warrant a scolding); otherwise when they call
   her Crash, the word is used affectionately, and it is that affection
   which makes all the difference.

   It’s also important to note that Rainbow never tells the Wonderbolts
   about how the nickname makes her feel, until the very end. As far as
   the Wonderbolts know, Rainbow Dash is doing perfectly fine, except
   for the occasional crash. They don’t know that the nickname they’re
   calling her by is the same one that bullies used to tease her with;
   there’s no way they can. But when Rainbow Dash finally does tell them
   at episode’s end, the Wonderbolts take her incredibly seriously, and
   they don’t make fun of her at all. This makes what happened not the
   result of hazing, but rather miscommunication, as there never was
   that much needed dialog between Dash and the Wonderbolts until the
   very end.

   In any case, the episode’s moral certainly isn’t pro-hazing, nor is
   it even pro-name-calling because at no point does the episode assert
   that it’s better to call ponies/people by such nicknames (if it were
   pro-name-calling, why would the mane 6 be there to validate Rainbow’s
   concern?). Rather, the moral is more about the importance of small
   nuances, as well as the importance of open dialog and trying to
   understand other cultures. It’s also about taking pride in one’s
   accomplishments and being humble enough to laugh at one’s failures.

    |  As a Navy flier, this episode was surprisingly accurate in it's
    |  lesson and the dynamics of being the new guy in the naval
    |  aviation community... so much so, that I was watching the credits
    |  looking for a "Special Thanks to the US Navy" credit and
    |  wondering if one of the show writers has an aviator in the
    |  family.
    |
    |  Everyone knows Top Gun, and the super awesome nicknames and
    |  rivalry... in reality, "Call-signs" are assigned to new guys/gals
    |  when they arrive at their first operational squadron, and often
    |  reflect an embarrassing incident in their training pipeline. So
    |  it's less "Maverick" and "Iceman" and more "Skittles"... because
    |  they once spilled a bag of candy in the flight-station and
    |  prevented the aircraft from flying due to FOD-ing (Foreign Object
    |  Damage) it out... or "Skidmark"... because they had a tail-strike
    |  on landing and tore off an antenna... or "Meat Stick"... because
    |  they got drunk as hell during API in Pensacola and bragged about
    |  the massive size of his d**k. A lot of Type A fliers get all bent
    |  out of shape because they were expecting something cool, and they
    |  have to be told that that's just the way it is... that everyone's
    |  got something similar... and that as you get qualified and are
    |  accepted, the call-signs go from derogatory to endearing.
    |
    |  Another element the episode nailed is the "new showoff" mentality
    |  that we constantly have to fight... guys and gals come into the
    |  squadron thinking they're total bad-asses with their 150 flight
    |  hours of Fleet Replacement Squadron training, and try to showboat
    |  or carve out a personality that sets them apart. We always have
    |  to knock them down and show them their place... most realize
    |  quickly that they need to shut up, pay attention, and get
    |  qualified... but sometimes they're just too Rainbow Dash.
    |
    |  Heh, I think I just found our call-sign for the next stubborn
    |  showoff that checks into my squadron!
    |

   This is just such a good comment! I don’t really have anything much
   to say about it, but I hope everyone in the fandom reads it after
   watching the episode (or before watching it).

   Now that I think about it though, there does appear to be a trend
   with MLP staff fitting more military related themes into Wonderbolts
   episodes. I remember watching FOBE Equestria do a military bronies
   react to “Wonderbolts Academy,” and over there they too seemed to
   take it as a shout out to the military. Maybe they’ll keep up the
   trend.

    |  I can't believe how many ppl hated this episode chanting "cringe
    |  cringe cringe". seriously? If we don't like the episode than we
    |  can just shut our mouths and that goes for myself too.

   I don’t know 786, but sometimes certain episodes feel like they’re
   designed to make you cringe. This one ends up having quite a few
   similarities to “Brotherhooves Social.” Big McIntosh just endures
   blow after blow and there’s no doubt that it’s painful, but with such
   a sweet ending, it makes for a great episode. That said, I don’t know
   if you’re supposed to enjoy watching the earlier two thirds of it.
   The same goes for watching Rainbow Dash impersonate each of the other
   Mane 6 in this week’s episode; you simply feel all the crap that
   Rainbow Dash is going to get for each stunt before it happens, and
   that’s not a fun feeling to take in. But it has the same turn around
   effect at episodes end, so it’s clearly a good episode, but that
   doesn’t mean it’s enjoyable to watch. My friend IRL had this issue,
   and he couldn’t really judge the episode because of the mixed
   feelings. I also found it a bit cringe full on the first viewing, but
   I didn’t feel the same cringe when I watched it a second time (I
   guess this makes the humor amortized?)

   I guess this asks the question of whether we want the show to do more
   of these kind of episodes. I think they make for some really great
   stories, but I wouldn’t want every episode to be so heavy on the
   first viewing. After all, this is My Little Pony we’re talking about;
   it should be light hearted more often than not even though I really
   do like stories such as “Newbie Dash,” “Brotherhooves Social,”
   “Feeling Pinkie Keen” …

   Wait a second, all these episodes are written by Dave Polsky. POLSKY
   IS PONY TORTURER CONFIRMED!
