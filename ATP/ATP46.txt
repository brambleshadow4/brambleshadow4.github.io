            Responses from the Fandom “Dungeons and Discords”

   After writing many responses beyond those featured last week, I now
   have the joy to write even more. Let’s get rolling!

    |  While I enjoyed this one more than 'What About Discord?', I still
    |  found this episode underwhelming because of one simple thing:
    |  Discord. Yeah, him. Every episode involving him focuses WAY TOO
    |  MUCH on his antics and far less on the subject matter. I was
    |  hoping for an adventure episode where they traverse the lands of
    |  the game while Discord is being his stubborn self but slowly
    |  comes to like all of it. This was more of, well, random chaos. So
    |  for an episode with only Discord doing Discord things, it is
    |  10/10, but it wasn't that. It was an episode with Spike and Big
    |  Mac with a really cool premise. I still enjoyed the episode for
    |  what it is, but mostly because of Spike and Fluttershy at the
    |  beginning, and some of the Discord jokes worked, but to me, most
    |  of them fell flat. Discord episodes have the wrong idea I think.
    |  Yeah, he is chaos incarnate and random and prankish, but there
    |  needs to be some restraint.
    |
    |  It wasn't a bad episode, but for the premise and the potential,
    |  it was just disappointing. I feel like there was just so much
    |  more potential. I mean, they didn't even get to the game until
    |  half-way through, and the whole Discord being stubborn thing at
    |  the table went on too long. I will say that I did like the ending
    |  though, it was fun looking, I just wish there was more of THAT.
    |
    |  If I had ot rate this episode, probably a 5/10. Not bad, not
    |  really good, just average.

   Kyoshi mentions Discord’s use of magical mischief and its effect on
   the overall episode, and I think this is a valid critique of not just
   this episode, but every Discord episode following “Keep Calm and
   Flutter On.” But while Discord’s magic is almost always unnecessary,
   it’s also the one thing that differentiates Discord from all other
   characters. After all, Discord was defined to be the spirit of
   disharmony back in season 2, and with disharmony comes total chaos.
   Dropping this characteristic would make Discord feel less like
   Discord, but at the same time, isn’t he supposed to be reformed?

   I don’t know where I personally would draw the line between what’s
   too much and what isn’t enough (though this episode nailed the
   balance for me). If we want to venture off into speculation, I
   suppose that Discord’s actions could be interpreted as nothing more

   than a performance. Depending on whom he’s with and what happens
   around him, he reacts to it in order to elicit the greatest response
   from those he’s around. This makes him the ultimate troll lord, which
   in turn makes me ask if he keeps up the performance when there’s no
   pony around to see it.

   Really, I don’t think I’d ever tell Discord to turn it down a notch
   unless it was getting in the way of the story, though it’s hard to
   determine whether anything Discord does could actually do this. As
   long as he doesn’t filibuster for more than a minute, the story will
   always move onwards, and whether pro Discord or not, you’re not stuck
   with one gag for too long.

    |  I've got to say, I've really liked Discord's depiction over the
    |  last couple seasons. He has this preoccupation with being
    |  perceived as some kind of stock "cool guy," but in his quest to
    |  be seen that way, he often denies himself satisfaction. One has
    |  to wonder if he really enjoys going out to swing clubs in zoot
    |  suits and fedoras, playing poker and dancing the night away, or
    |  if he only surrounds himself with those trappings, because that's
    |  his idea of what a "cool" guys' night is supposed to be. I know
    |  our culture tends to tell us there's one way to be an interesting
    |  guy to hang out with--go out clubbing, be emotionally
    |  inaccessible, play "manly" games, etc. It's interesting how this
    |  episode subverts that perception by in fact saying that Discord
    |  is the one that's kinda weird. In this story, it's Spike and Mac
    |  who are doing something a little normal.

   ph00tbag here provides a really interesting take on Discord not too
   dissimilar from my own idea of Discord’s nature being more of a
   performance than genuine style, though I hadn’t considered that
   particular part of Discord’s performance to be fabricated. But then,
   besides messing around with other characters, how could we ever
   really know what Discord actually likes? He seems more of the type to
   leave others guessing than to actually reveal his true self.

   If Discord is trying to conform and act like your typical Equestrian
   stallion, who is he looking to as a reference? Spike and Big Mac are
   the only two male characters we see often, and it’s probably safe to
   assume with all their secret whispering that their Ogre and
   Oubliettes game is probably not considered normal. But then, if we
   take Friendship is Magic #11 (the comic) into consideration, the
   whole O&O thing is probably more common that we’d expect.

   In our world, D&D’s popularity is only growing, to the point that it
   also probably isn’t considered a weird thing. Given the fact that
   there’s also probably a lot of MLP fans who are also roleplaying

   fans, it’s even possible to interpret the opposite as true. Thus
   Spike and Big Mac would be conforming to stereotypes from our world
   while Discord actually breaks them by wanting to do something
   different. Especially with D&D and roleplay’s popularity on the
   internet, I tend to consider Big Mac & Spike’s behavior more normal
   than Discord’s. Either way, it’s likely that the audience will feel
   connected to one group or the other which in turn makes the episode
   feel more relatable, so it’s a plus either way.

    |  I'm not going to do any funny introductions or anything cause I
    |  just don't care just Dungeons and Discords written by Nick
    |  Confalone and my thoughts.
    |
    |  Imma just say I don't play DnD so I didn't really care for the
    |  premise from the get go. That being said I still had high hopes
    |  for this episode because it had potential. I was honestly
    |  expecting an episode like Power Ponies... but, ya know... better
    |  cause Power Ponies was terrible. Unfortunately we did not get
    |  that, what we did get is an episode with 2 acts of nothing and a
    |  third act with 4 minutes of something kinda. and a terrible
    |  ending.
    |
    |  Its boring, boring, boring, Discord acts like a whiny little c***
    |  for the entire episode when he could have just left when he saw
    |  what Spike and Big Mac's idea of a 'guys night' was and wasn't
    |  interested..
    |
    |  There were parts that made me cringe, especially Spike and Big
    |  Mac's little... dance? I honestly have no clue what that was I
    |  just hope they never do it again.
    |
    |  I'm just annoyed cause Nick is a decent writer... well at least
    |  better than this (see The Saddle Row Review). It truly is insane
    |  how good this episode could have been if it had focused on the
    |  game and not Discord trowing a tantrum over wanting to do
    |  something else like a 5 year old.
    |
    |  I'm done, Dungeons and Discords 5.5/10
    |
    |  It's trash
    |

   But, Zantetsuken, isn’t this really the entire point of Friendship is
   Magic? Simply getting to watch our favorite ponies learn and grow
   throughout mostly normal experiences in their lives?

   I don’t know what most think of earlier seasons, but seasons one and
   two really thrived on these kind of experiences. Almost every episode
   started out as either a day at work, or a day off from it, but from
   there they always branch away the normal and into what’s actually
   meaningful. Sometimes, the transition is due to an event taking
   place, but sometimes it’s just a conversation that starts the ball
   rolling.

   I also think that as the seasons keep coming, most tend to forget
   that episodes don’t need to have world exploring or entire new
   races/species introduced in order to be good. Sometimes, all that’s
   needed are small interactions and gestures between different
   characters. For instance, nothing really happens in “Amending
   Fences;” it’s just Twilight talking and hanging out with her old
   friends in Canterlot. Yet this episode ended up being loved by many
   fans, and it has everything to do with the way Twilight and
   Moondancer interact with each other.

   This is what I think “Dungeons and Discords” was aiming for, a
   compelling story based on the interactions between Discord, Spike,
   and Big Mac. The game, although aforementioned by the title, is
   really secondary, as I believe it also is in real life. It’s not so
   much the game itself, but whom you play it with, that is the source
   of the enjoyment (of course, you can also like the game objectively,
   but if you can’t find any friends to play it with, you’re still out
   of luck).

   Also, if the episode’s really trash, why rate it 5.5/10?
