   It’s that time of week again. Let’s hear what some of you had to say
   about “The Cart Before the Ponies”

    |  It's a shame that the adults needed someone to yell at them.
    |
    |  The fillies WERE making their desires known, but the adults
    |  weren't listening.
    |
    |  As a kid, you shouldn't need to yell, but honestly, it might have
    |  helped.
    |

   This kind of remind me of the satirical “A Series of Unfortunate
   Events” by Lemony Snicket. In that series, there’s a joke that all
   the “responsible” adults are incompetent and that the villains always
   get away because “no one ever listens to children.” This actually
   brings up an interesting point, because often in children’s
   literature, it is the kids that save the day, not the adults. As MLP
   is aimed towards a younger audience, one wonders if it would be okay
   for the CMC to save the Mane 6 every once and a while.

   However, any kind of adult-child relationship like this is a little
   undermined by the fact that Rainbow, Rarity, and AJ are the
   protagonists of the show at large, and the CMC are only secondary
   protagonists. As protagonists, there is an expectation that it is
   they who will either save the day or screw up and learn their lesson.
   Normally CMC episodes choose the former, and one of the Mane 6 step
   in and help the CMC, but here the latter is chosen which causes the
   reversal of roles.

   In any case, I do agree that it’s awkward, and I know the writers
   tried to shift some of the fault on to the CMC, but that too
   backfired in my opinion. Especially so because neither AJ, Rarity,
   nor Rainbow picked up on the numerous hints that their actions were
   not what their filly wanted. I mean, how do you not notice the CMC
   constantly interfering with the cart design?

    |  Yeah, it was just kind of frustrating the whole time. If the
    |  sisters were going to actually steal the show, they should have
    |  succeeded and then felt guilty about it. Seeing them fail was no
    |  fun. And the "responsible adult" roles at the end were no fun

    |  either. Of course adults should still want to race carts!
    |
    |  And if the sisters had listened sooner, then they could have
    |  switched partners so they could actually work as teams. Would
    |  have been cool to have some bonding time between different pairs
    |  than usual. Yes it's better for adults to give up their fun in
    |  favor of the kids rather than taking it all for themselves, but
    |  it's better still to manipulate the situation to where everypony
    |  is doing what they really want to do.
    |
    |  And then there's Derpy... why why why not have her work with
    |  Dinky? I would have been so happy :(
    |
    |  Rarity's swan cart was the best part of the episode.
    |

   Dekutree brings up a lot of interesting ideas in her/his post, and I
   think it would have been cool if the writers did pair the CMC
   differently among their sisters. We do know (from Sisterhooves
   Social) that Sweetie Belle is fond (or used to be) of Applejack after
   all, so that pairing would work. I don’t know about the others
   pairings; could Scootaloo really handle Rarity’s personality?

   Anyways, I don’t know if it ever crossed the CMC’s minds to ask
   someone other than their (adopted)? sister. Looking back at the
   episode, Cheerilee suggests working with the pony you want to ride
   with, but not the most qualified pony. Only after this line does she
   even mention the ribbons, and before then the CMC made remarks that
   they knew who they were going to ask. So the top priority seems to be
   not winning a ribbon, but just having a good time while working
   alongside an older, more knowledgeable pony.

   But suppose they did mix it up, and Applebloom worked with Dash,
   Scootaloo with Rarity, and Sweetie with Applejack. In this situation,
   the motivation behind their actions becomes a desire win the ribbons,
   instead of just having fun and trying something new. The episode
   already puts a pretty big emphasis on winning, given the fact that
   the prizes are custom-designed blue ribbons with a big “1” on them as
   opposed to plain old prize certificates (which from my experience,
   are the norm for this kind of thing). With this emphasis on winning,
   what’s the moral of the episode supposed to be, “winning is magic?”
   That theme seems rather worse than the “don’t get swept up by your
   own personal agenda” idea. But who knows? Maybe the writers could
   introduce some other conflict into the story as well.

    |  You know, this episode really touches on an aspect of adulthood
    |  that's often overlooked. Experience has its own set of blinders,
    |  and they often leave adults unaware of how their actions are

    |  perceived by the young people around them. It's incredible how
    |  easy it is for us to forget what the generation gap looks like
    |  from the other side. Generation X was furious throughout their
    |  youth that the Boomers repeatedly accused them of being lazy,
    |  disrespectful, and whiny, and now Gen X says the same thing about
    |  Millennials. On the same gear (it begins), it's easy to see how
    |  easily RD, AJ, and Rarity would lose sight of what the derby was
    |  really about. It's not that they've not ever felt like a third
    |  wheel (har har) themselves, it's that there's some weird blind
    |  spot (oh dear) that makes theory of mind weaker when dealing with
    |  younger generations, and from the older side, it can be
    |  surprisingly difficult to see when it's time to let go of the
    |  wheel, and let the younger generation drive (I can't control it
    |  anymore). It's not like RD, AJ, and Rarity don't know what
    |  they're doing is wrong; When the consequences of their
    |  selfishness are laid at their own feet, though, they immediately
    |  able to empathize, and they don't need an explanation of what
    |  they did wrong--indeed, they provided much of the rationale for
    |  why they ought to have taken a back seat (send help). They were
    |  just exhibiting a common trait of the generation gap. So I don't
    |  really see it as out of character at all. The way RD, AJ, and
    |  Rarity act is downright typical of adults when interacting with
    |  youngsters.
    |
    |  All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this episode. It wasn't one of
    |  the best episodes, but it was really cute, and the song was one
    |  of the best this season. Derpy winning most creative as a foal
    |  had me in stitches. My favorite aspect of this episode, though,
    |  was Anderson's motif of playing incidental hits whenever Rarity
    |  said, "big, and bold." He even repeated it with noticeably less
    |  verve when Sweetie Belle mimicked her sister, but without the
    |  same enthusiasm. Everyone sleeps on William Anderson, but he
    |  consistently delivers in this show.
    |
    |  Also, lol at Scootaloo's chicken cart.

   This is probably the most interesting response I’ve heard about the
   episode, though I’m surprised ph00tbag doesn’t mention “helicopter
   parents.” You know, those parents who are so determined to make their
   kid’s life as great as possible, so they control everything and
   monitor them 24/7. I think that’s a better comparison to make, as I
   don’t think the big ponies find the (my) little ponies lazy or
   disrespectful (in fact, all three are quite industrious and
   appreciative of the help). Instead, AJ, Rainbow, and especially
   Rarity, are so consumed by their own vision of what a childhood derby
   should be like that they impose this vision on their younger sisters
   without asking. This is the exact same thing as helicopter parenting,
   and it too is fueled by a desire to create the perfect childhood
   (sometimes, because the parent didn’t get the childhood he/she
   wanted, kind of like Rarity didn’t win ‘Most Creative’).

   And William Anderson’s music is totally the bomb! When the montage
   music started playing in the episode, I was thinking “YES! Anderson
   finally gets another chance to write some super catchy filler music
   like he did way back in Season One.” When the fullblown song arrived
   later, I actually was a little disappointed, because I totally was
   hoping to get a little more Anderson. In the end, I’m just happy the
   music team is stellar, as always.
