                 Comment responses to “The Crystalling”

   I’m actually surprised we got a comment response this first week! Way
   to go fandom for once again blowing my expectations:

    |  I wonder if Sunburst could become a mentor for Flurry Heart, and
    |  if his immense knowledge of magic will make him a great asset for
    |  Twilight and Starlight later on. Maybe he can end up as a rival
    |  to Twilight stealing Celestia’s favor.
    |
    |  I know the series has been going this way for a while, but what
    |  do you think of the evidence that once again most of the work in
    |  the episode is done by Twilight and Spike, with Rarity and Pinkie
    |  Pie being mostly useless, and Fluttershy, Applejack, and Rainbow
    |  Dash being completely useless. Maybe it is because of the lack of
    |  magical powerup devices that require the all 6 of our mane cast
    |  to be present, so there isn’t a reason for them to be there.
    |
    |  Speaking of powerups, this episode has had a bit of interesting
    |  criticism, since there was a ( proven fake) animatic that was
    |  released earlier that seemed to be an alternate version of the
    |  episode where rather than evolving around Flurry Heart breaking
    |  the Crystal Heart, the conflict seemed to involve powerups or I
    |  think they were the hero items from guardians of harmony? It was
    |  an interesting comparison as it felt like a version of the
    |  episode that as more in line with the action packed premieres
    |  many like.
    |

   Erroria makes a great point that while we do get to see all of the
   Mane 6 in an episode, this leads to the episode depicting them as
   useless and without reason to be there. This is a very good point, as
   when the writers try to utilize more and more characters, it becomes
   harder and harder to make sure that every character truly is needed.

   This is not anything new though. In seasons 3 and 4, the premiers
   involved all six mane characters, even though both were primarily
   about Twilight. Season 5 breaks away from this a bit, as it makes
   sense for all six of them to venture off even if they all aren’t
   critically involved. The season 6 premier matches mostly with season
   5 as all six once more set off for an adventure, but what the writers
   should be striving for is another season 1 or season 2 opener, where
   all the characters are involved and are critically important to the
   story.

   As far as the choice to not have the mane 6 wield the elements of
   harmony (or a similar device), I actually think that’s a good idea.
   We’ve seen many friendship ex machina stories in the series, and as
   much as I like them, if the show utilizes them in every two-parter,
   the show will become too predictable. Despite any grievances any pony
   might have with the season 5 finale, the concept of Twilight
   extending her friendship to Starlight in order to prevent her from
   destroying everything is quite good, and I’d say the season 6 premier
   tries to continue that trend with Starlight and Sunburst.

   And now I’m going to steal a few independent responses to the episode
   from the unsuspecting part of the fandom, mainly those on EQD.

    |  Eh, I find the premiere to be average.
    |
    |  Things to like were Spike getting some better writing here and
    |  Shining Armor’s funny insomniac reactions and Luna and Celestia
    |  doing something even though it isn’t much development. Also,
    |  Twilight Velvet and Nightlight getting lines though would have
    |  prefer them to have a bigger role such as giving the royal couple
    |  parenting tips (could actually be episode potential and probably
    |  get more into backstory of Twilight’s family).
    |
    |  Again, I must restate how I don’t like the name Flurry Heart and
    |  prefer Skyla over it. Also, still not liking the design that
    |  feels like it’s trying too hard to be cute (and almost G3.5 like)
    |  with the big eyes and disproportionate wings and whatnot. Also,
    |  oddly enough it doesn’t fit with the rest of the ponies yet
    |  prefer Pumpkin and Pound Cake instead. I do find an eerie
    |  semblance with AleximusPrime’s artwork too (look him up) which
    |  adds to the oddness/off-putting feel of the design. Not to
    |  mention Flurry Heart’s parts I find to be really boring as it
    |  hunkers down on the overpowered uncontrollable baby cliché.
    |
    |  Also, Magne- er.. Alicorns how do they work? Man, does it feel
    |  like at this point that they are pulling a ton of crap out of
    |  their flanks with the whole alicorn biz. Also, it does make
    |  Twilight’s ascension feel kinda moot and slightly insignificant
    |  with a naturally born alicorn. Rather be it a unicorn instead.
    |
    |  Even though the Starlight and Sunburst parts were better than the
    |  baby ones, I still have some issues with it too. Such as dragging
    |  out the truth and their feelings for one another that felt rather
    |  cliché and awkwardly forced, like coming from a bad rom com.
    |
    |  As for Starlight herself, I’m still not on board with her and
    |  just find her to be meh. Still basically think that she’s another
    |  Twilight archetype who might become Twilight 2.0 in the near

    |  future. Also, I still think she’s better off as a recurring
    |  character like Discord rather than part of the Manes and doesn’t
    |  become shoehorned into episodes when she isn’t needed/necessary
    |  (don’t want it to be S1 Twilight all over again). And again, I
    |  would rather have flop between two Mane teams than just Mane 6 +
    |  1. More interested in Sunburst and S5 premiere ponies anyways.
    |
    |  So, not really that all impressive, just an average start for the
    |  season.

   Zolgard here makes quite a few excellent points about not only the
   plot points of the premier, but also the design choices. With Flurry
   Heart being the only natural born alicorn Equestria has ever seen,
   I’d say the overall effect is that the episode overplays the
   importance of such a character. Not only do the new eye designs make
   her stand out from the earlier Pound and Pumpkin Cake, but the fact
   that she’s the only born natural alicorn differentiates her from all
   the other princesses, and in some sense, undermines them. This
   emphasis isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as to some extent Princess
   Celestia and Luna also have the same effect on Twilight and Cadance,
   but it only becomes a problem with Flurry Heart because she’s not
   really a character yet.

   A character, in any show, requires development, and without that
   development, the pony/person in question remains just a background
   pony. Flurry Heart doesn’t have that development, so I would not call
   her a character, but at the same time the episode kind of revolves
   around her. I’d say that Flurry Heart here is a force, in a similar
   way that the Everfree Forrest is also a force; it makes an impact on
   the show, but it remains static and unchanging. As it’s unlikely that
   Flurry heart will gain more development than she already has, it
   doesn’t make sense to make a force the entire subject of an episode.
   I think the episode could have been tweaked so that Flurry Heart was
   less important, it would work better. Later on, if she gains
   development, there might be quite a few interesting stories the
   writers could tell with her, but at the time being, it’s probably
   better to not overemphasize her role.

   As for Zolgard’s comments about Sunburst and Starlight, I think we
   should just wait and see what the writers are going to do with all
   the extra characters they’re putting in the show. We don’t really
   know what’s going on with them until the rest of the season develops.

    |  common effort of many ponies, not one Great Hero. Even Luna and
    |  Celestia get in on the act.
    |
    |  Starlight’s existence as a major peripheral character now makes
    |  sense, though I don’t want to see her as a “Mane Seventh.”
    |
    |  Spike at his best - highly competent, wisecracking, keeping
    |  everyone’s hooves on the ground.
    |
    |  Sunburst is a terrific new character. Most interesting male
    |  character the show has ever seen. At least since Iron Will, as
    |  someone pointed out. Most interesting stallion, though.
    |
    |  Sunburst and Starlight now provide a potential ship within the
    |  show which involves characters we like that will not muck with
    |  the dynamics of the Mane Six.
    |
    |  The new baby’s name makes perfect sense given the events of the
    |  story.
    |
    |  Twilight’s parents speak!! Very cool.
    |
    |  A smashingly good kickoff episode for S6 and a portent of good
    |  things to come, I think. Definitely worth a couple additional
    |  watchings very soon.
    |

   I agree with most of Hifibrony’s comments here, though I disagree
   with calling Sunburst the most interesting male character. While it
   might be a stretch to call Discord male (as we don’t know if
   draconequusses have gender), Big Mac definitely has a more intriguing
   side to him as revealed in “Brotherhooves Social.” Both of these
   characters definitely have their own story and perception of events,
   and seeing as they are more involved with the mane 6 that Sunburst, I
   remain certain that there will always be more parts to their
   characters worth exploring.

   That isn’t to say that I’m not excited to see another competent male
   character added to the mix. I’m also glad that Sunburst isn’t simply
   another powerful unicorn to rival Twilight, as both Sunset and
   Starlight are. His book smarts are even more impressive that
   Twilight’s, but without the raw ability, it will be interesting to
   see where his studies lead him.

   We’re past the 1,500 word mark. Hopefully we’ll see you next week in
   the comments!
