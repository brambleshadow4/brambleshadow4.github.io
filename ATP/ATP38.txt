   You know the drill. Let’s see what people had to say about this
   week’s episode.

    |  Given the script I strongly suspect this was written with
    |  Twilight going and then she was replaced by Patton last minute.
    |  That just aggravates me more. It should have been Twilight going.
    |  Not only do they make her miss going to Griffenstone with Dash
    |  they use Griffenstone as a reason for her to miss the con. Now
    |  not only does she miss out on being with her friend at the con
    |  she misses out on being with her friend in Griffenstone. That's
    |  absolute bs.
    |
    |  The worst part is I like Patton but really don't like him in this
    |  episode.

   I know zid’s annoyed that Twilight didn’t get much of a role in this
   episode, and I agree it’s sad that Twilight misses going to the
   convention with Rainbow Dash, but I would argue that this was
   intentional from the get go, and also that it’s an important part of
   the episode.

   If we step out of the context of the show, we see that in our world
   there are conventions, like BronyCon for example, that many people go
   to. Some have had the opportunity to go to BronyCon every single
   year, and some haven’t gone even once. This usually isn’t because
   they don’t want to go (although there are a few who could that choose
   not to), but because of life circumstances it just isn’t feasible.
   For instance, I have a friend who’s been in the fandom for at least
   four years who’s never been to Bronycon, and it’s because he lives in
   China. I, on the other hand, have only been in the fandom for two
   years and made it to BronyCon this past July because I was living on
   the east coast of the US. My friend is just like Twilight, a fan of
   the show since forever, and I’m the newer fan like Rainbow Dash, who
   got to go even though older fans like my friend couldn’t. That’s the
   reality.

   By having Twilight not be able to go, the writers sympathize with
   people like my friend. After all, if Twilight Sparkle, one of the
   most important ponies in all of Equestria can’t make it to a
   convention, it demonstrates that regardless of enthusiasm or status,
   it’s not always possible to do everything one wants. If both were
   able to go to the convention, the message would be the opposite; it
   would say that enthusiasm alone can get you there, which is not true

   on Earth. In the end, the writers chose to play the sympathy card,
   and while it is sad for Twilgiht, I’m sure many fans will feel less
   disheartened knowing that Twilight too couldn’t make it to a
   convention.

    |  Aight, Pros:
    |
    |  -Fluttershy isn't in it
    |
    |  -Patton Oswald playing the character he plays in everything
    |
    |  -They tried ☼
    |
    |  -Meta humor I guess
    |
    |  Cons:
    |
    |  -Sweetie Belle isn't in it
    |
    |  -Jokes kinda fell short
    |
    |  -What the fuck is that monster design
    |
    |  -Seriously
    |
    |  Ehs:
    |
    |  -I've only ever been to one con, so I'm not invested in the whole
    |  situation, but the jokes made about cons seem to be kinda
    |  uninspired. They're the jokes everyone makes about cons. Bad
    |  costumes, weird services, dakimakura, etc.
    |
    |  -The dialogue doesn't feel very natural, for some reason. It may
    |  just be the meta humor but every line kinda felt way too forced.
    |
    |  -Much like the rest of season 6, it doesn't really feel
    |  important. Like, at all. I mean, slice of life episodes are fine,
    |  but it's obviously trying to be extravagant, but the lack of
    |  effect on anything just makes it feel hollow.
    |
    |  Overall: 6.8/10, too much Muddy Water
    |

   How come I’m not surprised that Kif’s pros and cons mention both a
   lack of Sweetie Belle and Fluttershy as important aspects of this
   episode?

   Anways, aside from those ‘throw away’ reasons, I think Kif’s getting
   at something when he says that “it doesn’t really feel important.”
   I’ve always found that episodes featuring adventure tend to be
   hit-or-miss. The show almost always aims to have a meaningful
   lesson/moral presented at the end of the episode, and adventure alone
   doesn’t satisfy this requirement. However, I personally think this
   episode does have meaning in it, as Rainbow was able to befriend
   Quibble, but not without the strain of knowing he had radically
   different thoughts about the one thing their friendship was based on.

   For me, adventure episodes never work out when there isn’t a personal
   struggle that the protagonist faces. An example would be “Gauntlet of
   Fire” as Spike doesn’t face any internal struggle, nor does he face
   adversary. He pretty much does what he always does, easily waltzing
   his way to becoming the Dragon Lord. It’s so unsatisfying (though I
   know a lot of people really loved that episode, so I probably should
   hold my tongue).

   But it also sounds like Kif’s hinting at a larger problem with S6 as
   a whole feeling unimportant, empty and hollow, though he doesn’t
   delve into it much. One of the observations I’ve made about the new
   season (as well as 5) along these lines is that the show no longer
   has a pointed purpose like it did in season prior. However, I have no
   idea if this is something that’s crossed Kif’s mind or what. In any
   case, that’s a different subject entirely and one best held off until
   the end of the season when we actually know everything.

    |  This was probably one of the most relatable episodes of the
    |  entire show. As someone who still thinks the show is as good as
    |  it's always been, I've constantly had to put up with people who
    |  think it hasn't been good since Season 2 (and in some cases,
    |  Season 1). This episode not only poked fun at those people, but
    |  also pointed out many of them have perfectly understandable
    |  reasons for thinking the way they do. Not to mention, Patton
    |  Oswalt turned in an amazing performance. I can't speak for
    |  everyone, but in my opinion, the second half of Season 6 is off
    |  to a great start.

   As one of those pesky ponies who insists that S1 and S2 truly are the
   best, I kind of want to exercise my secret weapon (the lecture!)
   right now, but as I also like later seasons and especially this
   episode, I am less inclined to do so as we are already in agreement.

   But even more than just showing that those crazy “First season is
   best season” people are rational, I think there’s a lot to learn from
   the blow up between Quibble and Rainbow. As we all know that Dashie
   isn’t the smartest of ponies, and as Quibble himself was able to

   solve the puzzles faster than Daring Do, it is quite possible that
   Quibble’s reasoning is superior to Rainbow Dash’s. Despite this, the
   way he goes about debating with Dash is terrible, as he begins with
   his conclusions already drawn and doesn’t listen to anything Rainbow
   Dash has to say. Essentially, that first debate is approached with
   nothing but close mindedness, and like most close-minded debates, it
   ends in shouting.

   If the two were to stop talking then, Quibble really would have lost
   out, as Dash definitely had the insider’s scoop when it comes to
   Daring Doo. Fortunately for him, Quibble was saved from this fate as
   he ended up being dragged into Rainbow’s perception (though it’s more
   of a reality than a perception) of the Daring Doo universe. Only then
   was he able to actually have a real discussion with Rainbow. It
   serves as a really good parable for all the smart ponies out there:
   don’t be so obsessed with your intellect or your own arguments that
   you miss out in learning what other people know.

   More pony content coming soon. Catch you all after the upcoming
   episode.
