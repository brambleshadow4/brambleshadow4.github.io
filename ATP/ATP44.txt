      Responses from the forums: “The Times They Are a Changeling”

   As with all episodes that the fandom likes at large, I tend to have
   many bones to pick with it. However, this doesn’t change the fact
   that many are ecstatic with it.

    |  Originally, Gauntlet of Fire was the best Spike episode.
    |
    |  The Times They Are a Changeling changes that.
    |
    |  This is an amazing episode. So much here is done so well. Thorax
    |  is oh-my-Luna adorable and such a fantastic character in his own
    |  right. He's the best character introduced this season. You can
    |  see how much he wants to be accepted, but he feels ostracized
    |  because he doesn't enjoy what Chrysalis did, and no pony accepted
    |  him because of who he is. For Spike to be the one to bridge the
    |  gap is an excellent idea in itself and helps bridge it.
    |
    |  But what good would it be without Spike? Ever since Princess
    |  Spike, his character turned around spectacularly. Who was
    |  originally a character with no consistency has the most
    |  consistent characterization this season. Times is his best
    |  characterization as a flawed character, period. He shows his
    |  flaws, but he means well. At no point he did act dumb or greedy.
    |  His reasons were very believable. When he failed to stand up for
    |  Thorax, he felt obscenely guilty and wanted to make things right.
    |  Think about it, he was willing to sacrifice his reputation at The
    |  Crystal Empire over standing up for someone of a race that nearly
    |  took over Canterlot. His character development is super-strong
    |  while maintaining consistency and dignity.
    |
    |  And the song at the end…good golly, it's so good. Really hones in
    |  the entire theme of the story, Spike's characterization, Spike's
    |  decision to sacrifice his fame, and moral. On its own, it's
    |  excellent. Attached to the episode itself, it really becomes
    |  powerful. My eyes felt like welling.
    |
    |  It's not just my favorite episode this season. It may be the best
    |  of season six so far. Well done!

   Mind you, I really could have picked any post on the forum to respond
   to, but I’m going to respond to Dark Quivit’s because: a) our
   preferences for episodes are pretty much complete opposite, and b) as
   I’ve read several of Quivit’s posts criticizing episodes I enjoy, I
   think it’s only fair for me to do likewise every once and a while.

   That said, I disagree with Dark Quivit, though I don’t think the
   episode is bad, though compared to what we’ve seen from earlier
   episodes, I’d put it in the 33rd percentile (i.e. 2/3 of episode are
   better). It’s true that Thorax is cute and that the audience can
   relate to him, and it’s true that Spike exerts a benevolent
   character, but lots of characters from the show are cute, relatable,
   and sympathetic, so what’s the big deal? For me, it is the delivery
   of the narrative and its conflict that determine the quality of an
   episode

   In terms of conflict though, “The Times They Are a Changeling” is all
   over the place. The primary conflict starts out as one centered
   around Thorax not being able to have friends due to his changeling
   nature, but by episode’s end it’s all about Spike’s reputation and
   him regretting mistakes. Somewhere between the 15 minute mark and the
   end, all the interesting nuances of having to interact with a
   friendly changeling are scrapped to deliver a story about Spike and
   denial. It’s upsetting, because the story undermines any themes of
   trying to understand pariahs in favor of focusing more on redeeming
   Spike for his pitfalls.  So in the end, it’s not even about Thorax or
   inclusivity at all; it’s about “risking reputation in the name of
   friendship.”

   This is especially true in the song, as this is the one moment where
   Spike should be explaining to the others why they should treat Thorax
   kindly. But instead providing any explanation, he merely confesses
   “That sometimes I’m scared and I can make mistakes / And I’m not so
   heroic, it seems.” Never mind the fact he’s confessing to the wrong
   characters, it’s still completely irrelevant. Spike just said, “No,
   he’s not a thing. His name is Thorax, and he’s my friend,” so you
   would expect the song to explain to the others why Spike is friends
   with a changeling, but he never does. Instead, they all just roll
   with his confession, accept his conclusion without question, and any
   issue with Thorax being a changeling is dropped altogether. None of
   this makes any logical sense.

   In other words, as spoken by theonenamedDJ(*2):

    |
    |  Ugh, maybe I am getting too old for this show. Now spike himself
    |  was great and I can't say anything bad about the
    |  characterization, but the ending seemed so safe, saccharine, and
    |  far too optimistic for its own good. Because I'm sure if you sing
    |  really, REALLY well and with such LUV and PASSION in your heart
    |  you too can solve prejudice and paranoia. Yeah, no.
    |
    |  Stick to more personal social problems, like "Stranger than
    |  Fanfiction", or light character comedy like "saddle row review"
    |  because you are not smart or talented enough for something like
    |  this.

   While I think DJ is being a little blunt, the point’s completely
   valid. Spike’s confessional song at the end of the episode doesn’t
   close the can of worms opened up by Thorax’s existence; something
   more is needed to justify all of ponykind accepting him besides
   Spike’s word. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean we have to get
   rid of the song, just change the lyrics. After all, other songs like
   Equestria Girls manage to be both meaningful and persuasive. For
   instance, the lyrics

   “Hey, hey, everybody we've got something to say / We may seem as
   different as the night is from day / But you look a little deeper and
   you will see / That I'm just like you and you're just like me.”

   not only sound pretty, but also imply that the humans in EG have a
   lot in common and are capable of uniting together for a common
   purpose. On the other hand, the lyrics from “The Times They are a
   Changeling”

   “But if day can turn to night and the darkness turn to light / Then
   why can’t we imagine a changeling can change?”

   might sound pretty, but a pretty analogy doesn’t say anything about
   Thorax’s character. For instance, we could use the same analogy to
   “imagine a Nazis that’s nice.”

   Anyways,

    |  Another solid episode for Spike! Season 6 is really treating him
    |  well.
    |
    |  I think this episode had a really wonderful message about
    |  acceptance.
    |
    |  The song was ok.
    |

   Takai’s comment brings up an interesting question in my mind: is
   Thorax actually accepted at the episode’s end? Because all those
   lines like “If Spike says Thorax is his friend, then he’s my friend
   too” could just be empty words. Princess Cadance’s “I would like to
   extend my hoof in friendship” especially sounds a lot more like
   something a politician would say than a close friend, and as they all
   are Royalty/second-tier, they still need to maintain those diplomatic
   relations. Even if they weren’t really friends, they’d still probably
   say that they were.

   Disregarding any cynical interpretations of Equestrian politics, I
   think there’s a lot more to acceptance than merely saying “We’re
   friends,” though this phrase or similar seems to be uttered more and
   more often. Between the yaks of season five and the dragons of season
   six, it seems to be a go-to phrase used whenever the writers have no
   other way of convincing us that the two parties are indeed friends,
   and I find is detrimental to the show. After all, friendship is
   magic, not saying “we’re friends” is magic, and friendship is built
   through actions, not words alone.

   We know through Spike’s actions that he’s accepted Thorax for who he
   is, but I don’t think we can make that judgement call for Twilight
   and the others quite yet. I’m sure they all will live by their words,
   but until they do, those words don’t mean that much, for better or
   for worse.
