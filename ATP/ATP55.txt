    |  Humans are sexual beings. There may be exceptions here and there
    |  but in general that is a fact.
    |
    |  In terms of sexuality, you don't chose what you are attracted to.
    |  It just so happens as it does, maybe evolving over time, but it's
    |  not a deliberate choice.
    |
    |  With that in mind, take these characters we all grew to love.
    |  Their human-like behaviour coupled with their sentience and also
    |  cute looks makes them very appealing to their audience - not
    |  necesarrily in a sexual way, mind you.
    |
    |  We see many aspects of their life, but one of the main things in
    |  life is not dealt with - and for a good reason, the show is still
    |  foremost for kids -, namely the one mentioned above: sexuality.
    |
    |  This is were clop-artists and clopfic-writers and whatnot come
    |  into play, they allow us a glimpse at what we do not see in the
    |  show itself and it can be highly rewarding to consume what they
    |  provide.
    |
    |  Not to mention that the quality of some of what these people
    |  create is beyond impressive from a purely artistic point of view,
    |  whether the content is to your liking or not.
    |
    |  Of course there is not only pony-clop, there is humanized and
    |  anthro and everything in between as well, so it's no surprise
    |  that there are many people who enjoy those things, even if they
    |  might not be "into ponies in that way".
    |
    |  The important thing is to keep all this away from people who do
    |  NOT want to see it and sadly that sometimes fails which is just
    |  sad and I understand why noncloppers would be mad about that.
    |
    |  But your average clopper is not going to rub his favorite
    |  explicit things into your face if you do not want to see that!
    |
    |  As with everything there is a small obnoxious fraction that would
    |  do that and that sadly puts all of us in a bad light.
    |
    |  Clopping itself, though, is not hurting anyone, it is no reason
    |  to be ashamed and no reason for others to bash you for it.

    |  If you are NOT a clopper, I am sure you also have some fetishes
    |  yourself that you did not consciously chose to have, that others
    |  might maybe even consider weird or worse.
    |
    |  But just because they are unusual, would you want others to give
    |  you a hard time for having them?
    |
    |  So please stop calling cloppers sick or anything like that, can't
    |  we all just get along?

   “The Other Side: A response to Stealthypone’s ‘Why I Clop’” by
   brambleshadow4

    |
    |  In last week’s soapbox Stealthypone defended against the hate
    |  towards cloppers, but in that conversation, we never looked at
    |  why some fans feel so strongly about the subject, so I’d like to
    |  fill in with two reasons I think people are uncomfortable with
    |  clop.
    |
    |  One reason for discomfort is the discrepancy between the themes
    |  of FiM and the themes of clop. MLP:FiM is clearly about
    |  friendship, but looking at the strength and diversity of its
    |  female protagonists, it’s also fair to say FiM is about female
    |  empowerment. MLP r34 however, transforms these platonic relations
    |  into sexually explicit ones and portrays the characters not as
    |  complex figures but as sexual objects. Thus pornographizing MLP
    |  ends up discrediting the themes of the show, which make certain
    |  fans upset.
    |
    |  Another reason for discomfort is this idea of respect. If someone
    |  or something asks you not to sexualize them, doing so is
    |  disrespectful. While a TV show cannot directly tell us, the
    |  target audience and platonic narratives of FiM strongly suggest
    |  that it is a place to be left untouched by the sexual world. So
    |  when others create clop, it feels like an act of disrespect, and
    |  fans who wish to respect the show are consequentially upset.
    |
    |  To minimize this discomfort, it’s essential as Stealthypone says
    |  to “keep [it] away from people who do NOT want to see it.”
    |  However, this doesn’t change whether it’s icky or not, and it
    |  doesn’t stop fans from yelling at the other side trying to
    |  convince them they’re wrong. In short, isolation isn’t enough to
    |  resolve the issue.
    |
    |  There is one thing that I think can help bridge the gap besides
    |  ignoring the extreme on both sides: don’t let your stance on
    |  clopping define your place in the fandom. If you’re pro clop, be
    |  louder in your support of the show and ponies in general; if
    |  you’re an artist, make pony art that isn’t NSFW.  Let your

    |  fanaticism for the show outcry your fanaticism for the porn
    |  because at the end of the day, it’s celebrating pony for the
    |  non-sexual show it is which brings us all together.
    |

   On the origin of these two essays:

   The first one, of course, was a short essay posted on EQD through
   their “Community Soapbox”. Anyone is allowed to submit anything to be
   posted in that section, as long as it’s under 200 words. For
   community soapbox 12, they decided to roll with this essay as the
   headline, which I wouldn’t have deemed controversial except for the
   fact that it’s over double the max word count (it is 412 words long).
   Essentially, EQD broke their policy to feature an article defending
   clop, which can be interpreted as them taking a non-neutral stance on
   the issue.

   This is assuming that they wouldn’t feature an essay of opposite
   nature, one that was equally respectful with a similar word count,
   but instead explained arguments from the other side. I challenged
   myself to write such an essay, and I promptly submitted the above to
   EQD to see what they would do. I did get a response, “Hmm best to
   decrease the word count a bit. We are already getting quite a bit of
   complaining already for breaking it last time. Just don't go over the
   max” (Sethisto) so it doesn’t look like it will be posted.
