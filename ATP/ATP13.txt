   As always, the comments from the latest episode have rolled in! Never

    |  Okay, I have to get this off my chest:
    |
    |  Why did the show writers decide that the main series needed to
    |  copy the storyline of the Equestria Girls movies? It was a bad
    |  idea.
    |
    |  The problem with both Sunset Shimmer and Starlight Glimmer is
    |  that they have no distinct personality. The distinct
    |  personalities of the Mane 6 was probably THE essential ingredient
    |  that made this show great in the first place. Each one has
    |  certain traits that make them stand out and let them bounce off
    |  each other. What do Glimmer and Shimmer have?
    |
    |  Ever seen the Plinkett reviews of the Star Wars prequels?
    |  Remember his system for criticizing their lackluster characters?
    |  It was "describe the character without saying anything about
    |  their appearance or their role in the story." With the Mane 6 it
    |  is easy - there is TONS of stuff you could say about each of
    |  them. With Glimmer/Shimmer, the best one could come up with is
    |  "Well, they used to be mean, but now they're nice and are all
    |  nervous that people still think they're mean." Which is already
    |  possibly breaking the rules, since it talks as much about their
    |  story as their personality. They're just generic goodguys who
    |  used to be badguys.
    |
    |  This pains me, because I actually WANT to like them both. I
    |  really like their visual designs and their voice actors. But the
    |  writers aren't giving me much to work with here. Because whereas
    |  the Mane 6 feel are overflowing with personality and character
    |  that can breathe some life and fun into even a boring/generic
    |  story, these two are just boring and generic so far.
    |
    |  This stuff bothers me a lot less with secondary characters like
    |  Princess Cadance, but for a MAIN character? They really need to
    |  try harder.
    |
    |  I really hope Starlight Glimmer starts to develop some
    |  personality traits later that haven't been evident yet. Something
    |  like a bad temper or dark streak left over from her evil days,
    |  which actually turns out to be useful/not-all-a-bad-thing. Or
    |  even just some interests and hobbies besides magic & friendship.

    |  Because so far, she and Sunset Shimmer simply don't come close
    |  enough to the quality of the original characters to feel like
    |  they belong in the main cast.
    |

   Kicks McGee makes a good point about how similar Sunset Shimmer and
   Starlight Glimmer are, but I do think they have more distinct
   personalities than McGee gives them credit. Sunset, both before and
   after her redemption, definitely feels a lot different than just
   another powerful unicorn/human. Unlike Twilight, the opening shot of
   Sunset shows her sneaking out with the crown, and even when Twilight
   gives her chase, she remains unfazed and proceeds to steal the crown
   with that smirk on her face. It’s that smirk that really defines
   Sunset’s character, as it showcases her rebelliousness, which few
   other ponies have. Once both arrive at Canterlot high, that cocky,
   arrogant attitude remained with her, allowing her to easily take on
   the roll as an antagonist. Once reformed though, they had to humble
   Sunset, which caused her to lose a significant amount of that
   attitude, but there still was a little confidence left in her by the
   second film.

   A similar characterization happened with Starlight; she started out
   as this confident, magically manipulative, pony with this incredible
   façade of pleasantness, but after she got reformed, none of that
   remained, as once again, the writers had to humble the character.
   Heck, they even redid her mane, which definitely gives her a new
   visual feel to complement her new personality (or lack of). However,
   I think the above episode starts getting back to the real Starlight,
   as all those small, manipulative magic acts we get to see her do not
   only showcase her magic ability, but also this unabashed manipulation
   which while subtle, definitely gives us a lot more insight into her
   character than just a “hobby” for magic. Wouldn’t you call that a
   more dark side to Starlight?

   Anyways, I think the bigger issue is the immediate post-reformation
   state. Starlight seems like a completely different character in “The
   Crystalling” because she’s completely devastated by what she’s done
   compared to how earlier she really didn’t give a damn that she was
   about to destroy all of Equestria. When the writers makes such a
   drastic change, it’s almost like the writers are forced to add all
   sorts of exaggerated regret to their characters, to really hammer in
   the point that they’re reformed. But actually convincing us of this
   takes an entire episode, so there’s nothing left to explore but that
   exaggerated regret for some time. It’s a viscous cycle, but I think
   it could easily be broken if they simply didn’t 100% reform
   characters. Discord and Trixie are good examples of this; both are
   reformed, but both questionably so.

    |  This seems to be a pretty controversial episode, if these
    |  comments are anything to go by. I thought it was great.
    |
    |  For starters, the moral of the story is one of the best the
    |  show's done so far: everyone deserves a second chance. Even if
    |  you're a pompous douchewitch, or Literally Stalin, you deserve to
    |  be redeemed. That's a fantastic moral, and really seems in line
    |  with everything we've seen from the show recently.
    |
    |  Trixie got some great character development. I mean, we've seen
    |  her in 2 episodes already, but this is the first time we've
    |  really gotten a sense of her actual personality and feelings. As
    |  implied by her suicide attempt, she was in a very bad place, and
    |  when her first true friend abandoned her, she was willing to just
    |  end her life right there. I mean damn, I thought this show was
    |  for little grills. My personal headcannon (and what seems to be
    |  implied by the episode) is that Trixie's boastful nature on stage
    |  is just an act, and in real life she's been lonely and sad, until
    |  she met Starlight. Speaking of Starlight, it's nice to see her
    |  get even more development. She's really grown on me this season,
    |  and I can't wait to see what else they do with her.
    |
    |  I've heard a ton of complaints about Twilight being OOC, but I
    |  just don't see it. Twilight's only met Trixie 2 times before this
    |  episode, she has no idea whether or not Trixie's reformed or not,
    |  unlike Starlight who is actively trying to become a better pony.
    |  It's very much in her nature to freak out over this.
    |
    |  I do have some complaints with this episode that hold it back
    |  from being one of the season's best. For one, the setup for the
    |  episode felt really forced. Twilight of all people should know
    |  that you can't make friends within a day, the process needs to be
    |  more gradual. The fanservice also felt blatantly forced, every
    |  scene with DJ Pon3 made me cringe. Overall though, it's a very
    |  solid episode, but I can tell people are going to be arguing over
    |  it for a very long time.
    |

   I agree with Scootaluigi about the importance of the moral of this
   episode, but I’m not quite sure if it is as simple as every pony can
   be redeemed. If you think about how Trixie and Starlight were treated
   in Ponyville this episode, it’s not exactly like every pony (or any
   pony for that matter) was happy to see them. Plus, it doesn’t factor
   in to account many of the characters that will never be redeemed,
   like King Sombra, Queen Chrysalis, Tirek, etc.

   I guess the real question is how does a pony become redeemed in
   Equestrian society? The only characters ever to gain redemption are
   ones who become friends with the Mane 6, so does this mean that the
   Mane 6 has the power to outcast ponies from all of society? Perhaps

   friendship politics are a real thing in Equestria.

   The other thing that I’d be interested to hear Scootaluigi elaborate
   on is the nature of the background ponies and what the writers should
   or shouldn’t do in terms of placing them in scenes. A lot of people
   seem to be split on whether Derpy, DJ Pon3, and Cranky should have
   been in the episode or not. I must say I don’t really care whether
   specific background ponies are present or not, but a lot of fans
   really live or die by them, so maybe if there was some kind of
   ruleset to follow? I’d be quite interested in hearing some more
   defined reasons for why people thought their portrayals were
   cringe-worthy

    |  I've had it. I'm no longer looking at comments about the show
    |  anymore. It's just too painful now, to see people left and right
    |  calling out the show. I'm done.
    |

   Yeah, I must say looking through the comments on Saturday was quite
   the experience this week. There definitely seemed to be quite a lot
   of upset caused by this episode, and I don’t know about you, Mares
   Fillies, but I thought the episode was pretty spot on this week.

   That said, there does seem to be an uproar almost every time a new
   episode comes out, and this episode was no exception. But five days
   later, as I’m looking through some of the comments, I’m also seeing
   quite a few positive ones; in fact, the majority of the ones that
   have been up-voted are comments praising what the show did right.

   As someone who actually spends some time reading other’s comments and
   writing responses, I can tell you it’s a strange experience, but it’s
   also an interesting one. There’s so many people in this fandom that
   have strong opinions about the show, and so many are eager to share
   them with others. It’s kind of incredible really; there are far more
   comments on these threads for any single person to read, and yet
   everyone keeps wanting to add their perspective and thoughts to the
   mix.

   But along with everyone’s ability to voice their opinions comes the
   problem of not being able to identify what are actually well thought
   out arguments among the buckets of opinions with little to no
   warranting. My personal favorite phrase of the week is “out of
   character” (commonly abbreviated as OOC for whatever reason) because
   many are throwing it around without pointing at specific examples of
   actions that are “out of character.” It’s kind of hard to consider
   such claims without evidence.

   The whole discussion thing is a rough business, but I do think there
   is something to be gained by trying to understand other’s thoughts
   about the show. In some sense, it’s the only thing the fandom can do
   to better understand the show and what makes it special and unique. 
   But I’ve also heard that trying to pin down exactly what makes an
   episode good, what makes it “magical”, is a great way to lose that
   very magic. From that perspective, I think it’s absolutely necessary
   that every once and a while we all just take a step back and enjoy an
   episode for what it is.

   Oh, and in case any of you like to read super-downer comments that I
   mentioned earlier, BatwingCandlewaxxe(*4) writes:

    |
    |  Well, I didn't expect much from the episode, so I wasn't too
    |  disappointed; but still a bit let down overall.
    |
    |  For starters, the ridiculous amount of pandering to brony fandom.
    |  The pandering was fine in "Slice of Life", because that was the
    |  point of the episode. And the odd time or two it has popped up
    |  elsewhere has mostly been subtle and well-handled. Here, there
    |  was nothing subtle about it. It just seemed forced and badly out
    |  of place. Like it was being used to try and distract from an
    |  otherwise weak story. "LOOK AT THIS FANDOM WINK! and ignore the
    |  fact that the story is really weak and disjointed". The whole
    |  thing was just a complete hash. Trixie's modicum of character
    |  development was the only thing that saved it from being
    |  completely unwatchable.
    |
    |  Worse, Twilight was painfully OOC. I know the different writers
    |  like to put their own subtle spin on the characters, but again,
    |  there was nothing subtle going on here. It's almost like
    |  Confalone hadn't actually watched any of the show prior to
    |  writing this, but based Twilight's personality entirely on fan
    |  memes and jokes. Almost nothing about the way she was portrayed
    |  made much sense given her character development up to this point.
    |
    |  Confalone is well on the way to replacing Polsky as my least
    |  favorite writer. At least Polsky has a decent grasp of the
    |  characters (except Spike, but he's hardly alone there), and is
    |  capable of writing as many good episodes as bad ones. So far,
    |  Confalone has one fair and two bad episodes.
    |
    |  So far, only one good episode out of six; not really boding well
    |  for the rest of the season. It seems like all the best writers
    |  have left, and Season Six is going to be second-rate all around.
    |  Quite a letdown for a show that up until now has been one of the
    |  most intelligent programs of any sort on television. I really
    |  hope this doesn't kill the franchise before the movie, 'cause
    |  that is where it looks like it's headed.
