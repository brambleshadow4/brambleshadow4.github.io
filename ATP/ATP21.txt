               Responses from EQD: “Applejack’s “Day” Off”

   Apparently there’s a place to throw questions at me on Tumblr. I have
   no idea why you’d want to do that, but that box is now open. Throw me
   your questions and I’ll throw more back at you. In the meantime, here
   are some others’ thoughts on this week’s episode.

    |  My. What a... strange episode. Often we talk about ponies being
    |  out of character, but in this case I think that Applejack may
    |  have been hit so hard with the stupid-stick that the damage might
    |  actually be permanent. Previously all of the people shouting
    |  'unicorn master race ftw' were silenced by the argument that
    |  there were certain things unicorns just couldn't do well. Like
    |  all of the things poor people do on earth. Now, though, we have
    |  Applejack being completely shown up at her own job by two
    |  non-earth-pony absolute novices. Thought AJ was super enabled and
    |  practical? Nope! She's just a silly pony! (please don't talk
    |  about her little spa-troubleshooting. that doesn't come close to
    |  compensating for the episode's conclusion) In fact, this episode
    |  is a problem for the entire Apple family, because surely they all
    |  must have seen AJ doing the things she does, and yet she hasn't
    |  been corrected. And let's talk about that spa. I don't have an
    |  issue with it's existence, but I do have an issue with it being
    |  the default leisure activity for ALL of the mane six and
    |  (according to this episode) much of the rest of Ponyville's
    |  population. Why?! Lazy story-telling, that's why. We get to see
    |  Dash's spa-anxiety again, which wouldn't be so much of an issue
    |  were it not for the conclusion, which will make it seem
    |  played-out when we inevitably get yet another reprise of the joke
    |  next season. And, like a maraschino cherry atop a spelt cake, we
    |  get to see Rarity acting impatient and un-empathetic as well.

   I have to agree that AidanofVT’s initial reaction here was the first
   annoying little thought that popped into my head when the episode was
   complete. After all these years of picturing Applejack as a hard
   working Earth pony, now we realize that she’s actually a moron! It
   also doesn’t help that her plight is so close to the end of the
   episode; it pretty much leads directly to the lesson and blinds us
   from her earlier actions in the episode.

   Eeyup, I’m bringing up Applejack’s “spa-troubleshooting” despite
   AidanofVT’s wishes, but if you apply a little mathematical analysis,
   it’s easy to see how the numbers add up (yay math). Applejack
   accomplished some tasks that were easily done by both Twilight and
   Rarity, giving us a 1:2 ratio.  Thus, Rarity and Twilight both have a

   skill shared by 2/3 of the population. Applejack doesn’t have that
   skill, but can still get the task done, just inefficiently. To
   contrast, there are 8 + 7 ponies in the spa line plus Rarity and the
   two staff members, all of whom cannot fix the steam room, though AJ
   can. That gives us a ratio of 1:18, thus Applejack has a skill that
   only 1/19th of the population has. Rounding down, that’s 5.2%, the
   same percentage of students accepted into Harvard(*2) in 2016 (yay
   statistics). This is clear evidence that Applejack’s skill set makes
   her elite by some standards, and as we should measure ponies/people
   by their abilities and not lack of, her expertise here most
   definitely makes up for a few inefficiencies later on.

   But numbers aside, Applejack can get the job done, one way or
   another. Others like Twilight and the spa’s staff couldn’t, which
   definitely means that Applejack’s not a total nincompoop. Is this a
   triumph of the series for her? Absolutely not, but it’s also not
   complete and utter failure.

    |  While I didn't love the episode, I appreciated the message. As an
    |  artist, I've learned that we all have our methods in our
    |  practices which make sense to us, but it takes some outside
    |  perspective to see where we might be doing some unnecessary steps
    |  or missing something entirely. I saw so many people in the chat
    |  suddenly calling AJ a terrible farmer, but she's not. She's kept
    |  that farm running for years. She just needed to cut out a few
    |  unnecessary steps that she wasn't aware needed cutting out
    |  because she was on the inside of the problem.

   MarrikAzemus makes a great point that the episode’s moral is still
   good independent of AJ’s characterization. However, I would argue
   that the joy of each episode is not its moral, but rather in watching
   how that moral is explored through the story.

   Back in season one, the friendship lessons were pretty obvious: don’t
   overreact in certain situations, have confidence in your friends, and
   get along with other ponies. However, I’m rather fond of these
   episodes because they took the most humorous and ridiculous path to
   get to that moral. The surprise was not the final result, but how the
   show would get there.

   Episodes like “Applejack’s “Day” Off” don’t take advantage of this.
   Rather, they take a straight forward route from start to end, and
   there’s only a few gags along the way. The majority of the episode is
   nothing but plot. This would normally be fine, but due to Applejack’s
   simultaneous ability and lack of it, the plot ends up contradicting
   itself.

   This forces the moral alone to have to sell the episode. However, a
   good moral alone is not enough for me to enjoy an episode, as I’ve
   seen with previous ones. An example which comes to mind is “The Mane
   Attraction;” it has a great moral of staying true to yourself, but
   the writing alone isn’t stellar. It heavily depends on the music, and
   while I do enjoy it, neither the music nor the moral can replace the
   weaknesses of the writing.

   That isn’t to say that the writing in this week’s episode is bad, but
   it also isn’t particularly clever or witty. It doesn’t take any
   unusual twists aside from Applejack’s antics near the end, so it
   feels lack luster and unfulfilling compared to what we’re used to.

    |  I love it when they just discuss their daily lives like this. I'm
    |  glad they are bringing back these slice of life episodes. I don't
    |  mind adventure and all, but what made this show special
    |  especially for a college guy like me is that they just discussed
    |  their lives like actual girls. :P It's not like other cartoons
    |  where the girls would either talk about boyfriends and fitting in
    |  or some kind of non-nonsensical stuff, but rather just normal
    |  everyday life. It's very refreshing. :)
    |

   But Mares Fillies, haven’t the majority of the episodes this season
   been like this? The only one that really broke out into adventure was
   “Gauntlet of Fire.” After that, pretty much all of them have been
   usual business. Post Cutie Mark Crusader business, Wonderbolt
   recruitment business, store opening business, but still business
   nonetheless. Not even the season opener got away from the usual slice
   of life, as they were all there on family business. It’s actually
   quite unusual, as the previous five openers were all adventures or
   emergencies of the state.

   I personally like it most when episodes breathe the extraordinary
   into the ordinary daily routine. It’s the small, incredible things
   like Rainbow Dash pulling off a sonic rainboom or Fluttershy
   confronting a cockatrice that really keep me engaged in the universe,
   even more so than the adventures (which, if I’m honest, often feel
   like they’re trying too hard to be epic and exciting). I really want
   to see more of these little things in the show because they add so
   much to the classic slice of life. Chats in the spa are nice, but if
   they’re sandwiched between, say Fluttershy suddenly becoming a
   celebrity model, they become that much better.

   Also, there’s no way they could talk about their boyfriends because
   the female to male ratio of Ponyville is so skewed. There’s probably
   not even six colts available to begin with (which albeit is even more
   hilarious than anything they could say about them).
