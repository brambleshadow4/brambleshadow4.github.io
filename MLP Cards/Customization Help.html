			<h1>About customization and extensibility:</h1>
			<p>Along with the trading cards you'll find included by default, there's also the opportunity to create your own and add them to the overall program. </p>
			<p>If all you are wanting to do is add a small number of cards to the main catalog, you can easily create them in the create your own card section, save them to your collection, and then check the box in the import settings below. You can also share these cards with friends by copying the share URL and sending it to them.</p>
			<p>Note: without checking that box in the import settings, your cards will be saved, but they won't appear in the catalog, my cards, or market tabs.</p>
			<p>The website also supports adding many cards to the catalog by importing a JSON text file. Every card in the program is represented in JSON. You can copy an individual card's JSON code from the card JSON box, or an entire set of cards from the text box in the custom cards section. </p>
			<p>If you seek to import a JSON card file, note that it must be in the following format:</p>
			<p>[card1, card2, ... , cardN]</p>
			<p> where card1, card2, ... , cardN are all individual JSON cards. Essentially, the file must be a JSON array of card objects. You can see an example file "DerpySet.json" on this site, and you can also import it into the catalog by typing in DerpySet.json and pushing the add button.</p>
